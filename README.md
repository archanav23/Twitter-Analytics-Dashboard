# Twitter-Analytics-Dashboard
This repository includes a Twitter Analytics Dashboard created during my training and task solutions completed during my internship.
The dashboard analyzes tweet engagement using Power BI with advanced DAX filters and calculated columns.
Internship tasks involved working with filters like IST time slots, odd/even dates, media views, and app opens.
I also applied logic to exclude specific letters from tweets and analyzed tweet character count.
All analysis and visualizations were built entirely in Power BI using DAX expressions.
